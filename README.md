Last update: Sep 17, 2020

## Files
The file COVID19_tutorial_1.0.zip contains:   
- Matlab scripts: Maximum likelihood estimation of symptom onset time distribution (Script_IP_MLE.m) and infectiousness profile (Script_Infec_MLE.m); Estimation of serial interval distribution through convolution (Script_SI_convolution.m); Calculation of basic reproduction number (Script_R0.m); Quantification of different intervention measurements, such as testing (Script_R0_reduction_testing.m), contact tracing (Script_R0_reduction_tracing.m), and mask-wearing (Script_R0_reduction_mask.m).
- Sample data: Symptom onset time of 347 confirmed cases (/Sampledata/IncubationPeriod.mat) from three independent studies: Bi et al., 183 cases<sup>[2]</sup>; Xia et al., 105 cases<sup>[3]</sup>; Men et al., 59 cases<sup>[4]</sup>. Exposure windows of 66 infector-infectee pairs (/Sampledata/ExposureWindow.mat)<sup>[5]</sup>.
- Sample figures: Main results.
- Readme: Instructions for this MATLAB package.

## Installation
- Extract the content of the enclosed COVID19_tutorial_1.0.zip file to a local directory.
- Run the corresponding MATLAB script files. Running times for the scripts are less than 1 minute.   

(The codes were written on MATLAB R2016b)

## Outputs
For details regarding the methods, please refer to our manuscript<sup>[1]</sup>.
- Symptom onset time distribution (Script_IP_MLE.m): Maximum likelihood estimation of the underlying symptom onset time distribution of the 347 cases data<sup>[2-4]</sup>. Estimated parameters mu, sigma, gamma and the corresponding likelihood are displayed in the command window.

- Infectiousness profile (Script_Infec_MLE.m): Maximum likelihood estimation of normalized infectiousness curve using the exposure window data of 66 infector-infectee pairs<sup>[5]</sup>. Estimated parameters alpha_A, alpha_B, theta_P, theta_S and the corresponding likelihood are displayed in the command window.
![Infec](https://github.com/hkbu-covid19group/Calib-covid19/blob/master/Samplefigures/Infec.png)

- Serial interval distribution inferred through convolution of symptom onset time distribution and infectiousness profile. The above estimated P_O(t) and P_I(t) are used as inputs.

- R0-lambda curve (Script_R0.m): Basic reproduction number R0 as a function of daily growth rate lambda. The above inferred symptom onset time distribution and infectiousness profile are used as inputs. Estimated R0 at lambda=0.3 is displayed in the command window.

- Quantification of the effect of intervention measurements (Script_R0_reduction_testing.m, Script_R0_reduction_tracing.m): Calculation of reduced reproduction number Re under contact tracing (100% contacts are traced) and testing (no delay in testing report). The above inferred symptom onset time distribution and infectiousness profile are used as inputs.

- Quantification of the effect of population-wide face mask wearing (Script_R0_reduction_mask.m): Left, reduction of transmission rate under mask wearing. Right, heatmap of reduced reproduction number Re as a function of percentage of mask-wearing population and percentage of traced contacts (at day 4 after infection). The above inferred symptom onset time distribution and infectiousness profile are used as inputs.
